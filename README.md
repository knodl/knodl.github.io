## Pasha Loginov

Hi, I'm Pasha and I'm data analyst at VK (or vk.com) â€“ russian largest social network.
At work I do a broad list of data-related tasks starting from data cleaning and ending with prototyping ML-models to enhance our internal decision-making processes.
I'm really happy that my interests and my job are in sync, so my interests and hobbies are a bit data-related also.

Currently I'm trying to brush up my fundamental knowledge about statistics and also do some pet-project about A/B tests. I hope it will grow into something bigger than just pet-project though.
Maybe I will write details about A/B testing here, but we'll see. 

My formal resume can be found by the link below:
